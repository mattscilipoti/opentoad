== OpenToad

OpenToad is a clone of Pivotal Labs' HopToad, but with far fewer features.
Why should you use it instead of HopToad?  Well, right now, you shouldn't.
;-)

But it will be open source (GPLv3; see licence file)

== TODO list (to be converted to FEATURES list)

 * Create/retrieve errors via the web interface
 * update error status (etc) via the web interface
  * (only certain aspects of errors are editable)
 * Create errors via a RESTful (client) interface
  * it would be nice if we could be compatible with HopToad gem/plugin
  * or reuse code from the exception_notifier plugin
 * Errors are grouped, and the list shows them by group.
  * (abstract) able to order/organize groups
   * e.g. by count, most recent, area of application
 * Errors can be linked to bug tickets
 * Errors can be marked by priority (or leave this for bug tracker?)
 * Errors can be archived (presumably because they have been dealt with)
 * Multiple projects can use the same OpenToad instance
 * Users can login and be restricted access by project
 * (abstract) Individual Errors should capture lots of debug info
   * (abstract) Debug info should be parsed usefully
